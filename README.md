# FireGallery - demo

![image of firegallery-demo](./firegallery-demo.png)

An image gallery web application to manage images (like postimages). We can upload local image into cloud, delete it, copy it, see live gallery etc. 

**Tech**: react 18, tailwindcss, firebase (storage, realtime-db), bootstrap-icons

This project is developed and designed by *Rahat Faruk* (me). I wanted to explore more about react and firebase through this project.  

*Note: This GitHub repository contains some demo code of my full project*
